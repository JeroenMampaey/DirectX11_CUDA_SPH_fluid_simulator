Here are some code examples that demonstrate how to use the graphics library from the [lib](../lib/) folder, all of the programs use a [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) style architecture.

## [basic_example](./basic_example/)
This example shows how to both listen to Window events and how to use Drawers to draw to the screen.

## [instanced_drawing_example](./instanced_drawing_example/)
This example shows how to draw multiple objects using a single buffer (so called "instanced drawing").

## [multiple_screens_example](./multiple_screens_example/)
Though the library is not build for giving any kind of multi window management support, this example shows that it is however still possible to render and listen to multiple windows.
