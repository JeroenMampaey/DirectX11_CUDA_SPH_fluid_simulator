This folder contains the files for a CUDA accelerated 2D SPH simulation program. The code is optimized specifically for an Rtx 3060 Laptop GPU (see [algorithm_original_idea.md](./algorithm_original_idea.md)) but should run on any NVIDIA GPU that supports [Cooperative Groups](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cooperative-groups/) though shared memory constraints can possibly limit the maximum number of simulated particles. The program provides a simple default simulation layout but will also first look if a custom simulation layout has been specified as "simulation2D.txt" in the [simulation_layout](../simulation_layout) folder, if a file with the correct name exists then this simulation layout will be used instead of the default.
