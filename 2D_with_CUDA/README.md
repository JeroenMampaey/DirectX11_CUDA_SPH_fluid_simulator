This folder contains the files for a 2D SPH simulation program. This program uses CUDA and the GPU is assumed to be an Rtx 3060 Home GPU (or atleast optimized for this GPU, see [algorithm_idea.md](./algorithm_idea.md)), also this program requires the win32 API (thus windows only). The program provides a simple default simulation layout but will also first look if a custom simulation layout has been specified as "simulation2D.txt" in the [simulation_layout](../simulation_layout) folder, if a file with the correct name exists then this simulation layout will be used instead of the default.
