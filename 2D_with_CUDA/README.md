This folder contains the files for a CUDA accelerated 2D SPH simulation program. This code is optimized specifically for a 8.6 compute capability NVIDIA GPU (because I make assumptions about the size of the shared memory) and can handle 768 particles per SM. The program provides a simple default simulation layout but will also first look if a custom simulation layout has been specified as "simulation2D.txt" in the [simulation_layout](../simulation_layout) folder, if a file with the correct name exists then this simulation layout will be used instead of the default.
