This folder contains the program files for the 2D simulation_maker program. This program can be used to build a simulation layout and then this layout will be saved as "simulation2D.txt" in the [simulation_layout](../simulation_layout) folder. It is important to run this program from the binaries folder (since relative paths are used when writing the file).
