This folder contains the program files for the 2D simulation_maker program which is a (poorly made) program that can be used to build a simulation layout and then this layout will be saved as "simulation2D.txt" in the [simulation_layout](../simulation_layout) folder.

- Placing particles works by pressing the W-key and to start clicking and swiping with the mouse
- Placing boundaries uses the B-key and requires clicking the mouse
- Placing pumps uses the P-key
- Storing the file uses the A-key

Every boundary also has a side that can stop water and another side that will not, the side that does not stop water has a tiny red line. The pumps have a velocity direction that is indicated by a line, this direction (and also the value of the velocity component) can be altered using the arrow keys.
